## Description
Super touchy surface conditions. Our group triggered multiple slopes on north and northeast aspects near and below treeline. Crowns ranged from 6"-24". Some slides propagated through terrain features. The most sensitive areas were near treeline with soft wind slabs. Convex features slide consistently throughout the day as well. None of the avalanches stepped down into deeper weak layers. One avalanche hit our group in the knees in our "safe" spot. The debris ran further and faster than expected. All slides D1-1.5 N-NE NBTL. The main BTL gulley appeared to go natural during the storm maybe D1.5-2 at the most.

## Accident Summary
On March 8, a skier was caught, carried, and seriously injured in an avalanche off Raspberry Ridge on the lower portion of a run locally called "Money Shot".  The avalanche occurred on a steep northeast-facing slope around 10,400 feet that has avalanched multiple times earlier this season. The skier's partner assisted in digging him out of the snow and addressing his injuries. His partner then dragged him down nearly 600 vertical feet to the location of the summer trail, where search and rescue teams assisted. The skier was transported to the Aspen Valley Hospital via helicopter from near the summer trail.

## Description
Skied DT today. Originally felt ok about the choice because much of it had slid yesterday. The snow from overnight was about a foot or less deep on a crust, low in the couloir. 

Higher in the couloir the snow got deeper and my hackles went up, but hand pit results were not very planar and generally hard, but they were breaking consistently in the same place. We continued on. In the climbers left choke at the top we were fully wallowing, but again it felt rightside up and we continued.  

Skiing down I triggered the slide about halfway down the upper crux choke. It broke just above me and swept me off my feet.  I was luckily able to dig an edge in and arrest my slide fairly quickly.

The last couple of days have produced some of the most widespread avalanche activity I've seen in the park in my short tenure here.  Sharing this story, which I feel quite embarrassed about, as a cautionary tale as we head into a bluebird weekend with lots of fresh snow. 

Some avy stats.  Aspect: SE. Elevation: ATL. Size: D1? (The debris was pretty shallow). Crown width: 8ish feet in the choke, propagated to about 30 feet wide below. Crown height: varied from 3 inches to a foot at its deepest.

We noticed debris caused by cornice breaking creating a soft slab slide. If you zoom in on the picture with a snowboard, you can see some of the debris. After a tree run, I chose to ride a more exposed line. I was pretty sure that I would release a small soft slab wile riding, and that's what happened. Not a big deal, but wind slabs are real this week.

## Accident Summary
On Tuesday, February 25th, 2025, a skier unintentionally triggered an avalanche on a steep north-facing below treeline slope west of the town of Ophir in an area locally known as Mine Dump. This was a Persistent Slab avalanche that failed on a layer of faceted crystals in the upper snowpack and stepped down to deeper buried weak layers. The avalanche carried the skier into a tree, and he was injured. The skier's partner alerted a friend via radio, who called San Miguel County Search and Rescue (SMCSG). SMCSG evacuated the skier to a waiting ambulance, and he was flown via helicopter to the hospital.

# Avalanche Report: Elk Basin, CO

**Date:** 2/23/2025
**Type:** incident_report
**Zone:** Gunnison

## Description
Our tour up Elk Creek revealed soft crusts on Southern aspects and surface (~2-3mm) on shadier E and SE aspects below 10k elevation. Moderate winds persisted along ridges below treeline. All three of us had read the avy report for the day and had been following it all season, and all three of us have level II avalanche certifications or higher. Two of the party were equipped with float packs. Our test slope featured a treeless runout, and a steep entrance rollover followed quickly by slopes at or below 30* in steepness. The first skier was to ski cut the top and then continue to the bottom of the run (about 500 feet of vertical drop). We all had radios and planned to communicate while we were skiing, as well as planning our exits if something slid. 

Skier one executed a short ski cut on the steep rollover and continued for another few turns when the slope crack just above him to his right. He was swept off his feet in the fast moving avalanche and was lost from sight for about 100 feet. Eventually we saw his airbag balloon riding above the avalanche, and it stayed on top until the avalanche came to a stop, well into lower-angled terrain. He was buried up to his stomach sitting upright, and was not injured. The only gear lost was a pole. 

Skier 2 descended the the debris and then lower-angled slopes to aid in digging skier 1 out. Skier 3 quickly inspected the crown: the slide occurred at the interface between storm snow and our older, faceted, near-structureless snowpack from our long January-February dry spell. The storm snow had settled to 2-3 feet deep in this area, the top quarter of which was Fist hard, moving to 4F hardness for the rest of the slab until the bottom 6ish inches of 1F density. The weak snow below seemed to be 2-3mm facets. 

We lucked out in many ways, but we came prepared with knowledge and equipment, conditions reports, and the mentality that we were going to ski this slope as if it would slide, choosing our exit points and ski tactics carefully (though note that our intention was not to make it avalanche, and this slope didn't seem particularly dangerous in our initial estimations. Of course, seeing how widely this avalanche propagated, and how far and fast it ran, we clearly underestimated this slope).

## Accident Summary
Rider 1 descended toward High Trail Cliffs through sparse trees and low-angle terrain. Just above the steeper, cliffy portion of the slope, he cut a left-trending track south toward the parking area. He then turned downhill, navigating around some trees on a steep rocky feature at the southern end of the cliffs. He made a few turns above a clump of trees before the slope fractured. The avalanche broke to the north and spread into steeper terrain to the rider's right and across all of the avalanche paths. The avalanche dragged him through sparse trees and over rocky areas. It was around 4:45 PM. 

## Rescue Summary
The High Trail Cliffs are visible for a long distance in both directions from US Highway 40 over Berthoud Pass. Multiple motorists witnessed the avalanche catch Rider 1, saw the size of the avalanche, and called 911. Grand County Sheriff’s Deputies, Grand County Search and Rescue (GCSAR), and a Flight For Life helicopter carrying an avalanche dog team from Breckenridge Ski Area were dispatched to the scene. 

A family called 911 and continued driving downhill toward Winter Park. At the second hairpin turn on the north side of the pass, they saw two backcountry skiers (Rescuers 1 and 2) and alerted them to the accident. The skiers called another member of their party who was in the Berthoud Pass parking area and started skinning toward the avalanche site. The rider in the parking area and another recreationist who overheard the conversation (Rescuers 3 and 4) started toward the accident site as well. 

It took the Rescuers 1 and 2 about 15 minutes to ascend from the road to the avalanche debris. They turned their avalanche rescue transceivers to search and got a faint signal. Rescuers 3 and 4 arrived about 20 minutes later. The four refined the search area to a deep pile of debris on a bench near the bottom of the avalanche path. Broken trees in the avalanche debris hindered searching. Two more backcountry skiers arrived, and the growing group continued to narrow down the signal. The transceiver signal was fluctuating, but they found a location where their transceivers indicated a 1.5 meter (5 feet) burial. They got a probe strike and started to dig through the dense debris. They uncovered Rider 1’s leg first and were eventually able to excavate his head. About an hour had passed since the avalanche, and there were no signs of life. 

GCSAR transported the victim’s body back to the Berthoud parking area.

## Involvement Details
1 backcountry tourer caught, buried, and killed

## Lead-up Events
Rider 1 arrived at the Berthoud Pass parking lot around noon on February 22, 2025, for a day of powsurfing. He made a handful of runs in less steep terrain. Sometime before 4:30 PM, he skinned toward the top of Mines Peak and transitioned to his powsurfing board.   

## Avalanche Forecast
The Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s (CAIC) forecast for the area around Berthoud Pass for February 22, 2025, rated the avalanche danger at Considerable (Level 3 of 5) near and above treeline and Moderate (Level 2 of 5) below treeline. A Special Avalanche Advisory was in effect. The primary problem was Persistent Slab avalanches on west through north to east-facing aspects at all elevations, on southeast-facing slopes near and above treeline, and on south and southwest-facing aspects in the above treeline elevation band. The likelihood was Possible, and the expected size was large to very large (up to D3). The second problem was Loose Wet avalanches on southwest, south, and southeast-facing slopes near and below treeline. The likelihood was Likely, and the expected size was small (up to D1.5). The summary statement read: 

A Special Avalanche Advisory is in effect from Friday evening through Sunday evening for most of the Front Range, the mountains of Summit County, and the Gore Range. Avalanche conditions are dangerous. You likely won't see or hear any warning signs before triggering a deeply breaking, deadly avalanche. Several big avalanches were triggered over the last few days after multiple tracks were placed on a slope. Avalanches can be triggered from flat areas below steep slopes and lower-angle connected slopes. To stay safe in these conditions, give suspect slopes a wide berth. Choose lower-angle terrain and smaller slopes without terrain traps.

## Additional Comments
All of the fatal avalanche accidents we investigate are tragic events. We do our best to describe each accident to help the people involved, and the community as a whole, better understand them. We offer the following comments in the hope that they will help people avoid future avalanche accidents.

Traveling alone in the backcountry is riskier than traveling with a partner or in a group. Challenging situations or injuries that are more easily addressed by a team can be difficult or even insurmountable for an individual. Although difficult situations can be easier to manage with a group, there is nothing inherently wrong with traveling in the backcountry alone. People are drawn to the mountains by their beauty and the opportunity for adventure. We each choose how we want to face the challenges they offer and decide what is acceptable risk for ourselves. Traveling alone in avalanche terrain is not wrong, but it is a choice that allows little room for error.

Rider 1 was traveling alone but wearing an avalanche rescue transceiver. If you choose to accept the increased risk of traveling in the mountains alone, being searchable will help rescuers if you are involved in an accident. This puts fewer rescuers at risk because it is easier to find you. It decreases the time rescuers are exposed to danger and uses less of their very limited resources. In this event, members of the public went out of their way to assist in a rescue.

Members of the public who responded to the incident had difficulty locating a strong transceiver signal and had multiple phantom signals. It took them some time to rule out multiple burials. This could have been due to interference or an older transmitting or searching beacon. Checking that you are using up-to-date technology that is regularly serviced makes for maximal search efficiency. <a href="https://avalanche.state.co.us/transceiver-interference-guidance">Understanding sources of signal interference and techniques to combat them is important</a>. 

The feature that Rider 1 chose to descend is a very visible piece of terrain close to the road. Other riders had put tracks in a separate gully north of the area where Rider 1 descended. Tracks on slopes and proximity to trailheads, ski area gates, or the road do not mean a slope is safe. The choice of terrain did, however, mean that the avalanche was witnessed and other travelers were able to respond, eliminating a long search but not avoiding a tragic outcome.

## Accident Summary
Gravel Mountain, north of Granby, is a popular area for snowmobiling. Numerous riders from multiple groups had been riding in the area. There were many snowmobile tracks on the slope that later avalanched. There were three different groups of riders in the immediate area at the time of the avalanche. Group 1, a group of four snowmobilers, were climbing one at a time from the bottom up onto the cornice, turning around, and then riding off the cornice. Group 2 was riding on the slope to the north. Group 3 was watching from the bottom of the slope. 

Three riders from Group 1 were sitting on their snowmobiles about 10 to 15 feet back from the edge of the cornice, waiting for the fourth rider to join them on the top. The fourth rider had just crested the top of the cornice when they felt a collapse. The snow under their machines fell away, and three of the riders fell over the edge as the cornice broke and the slope below avalanched. One of the riders in Group 1 was caught in the flowing avalanche debris and pulled his avalanche airbag. When the debris came to a stop, he was partially buried with his head above the snow. The other two riders from Group 1 managed to self-arrest on the bed surface below the cornice, but their snowmobiles were pulled downhill by the debris. 
   
A rider in Group 2 jumped off the cornice, likely not seeing the avalanche on the slope below. He inadvertently rode into the flowing debris. When the avalanche came to a stop, he was partially buried with his head above the snow. Riders from Group 3 at the bottom of the slope scattered and rode away as the avalanche ran toward them. No one in Group 3 was caught. Four riders from two different groups were caught. Two were partially buried, but luckily, nobody was injured.

Grand County Sheriff's Office received a call about a "massive avalanche.” They initiated a search and rescue response. Grand County Search and Rescue team rode to the site and interviewed bystanders.

## Accident Summary
Skier 1 went first and started his descent just before 1 PM. He triggered an avalanche within 5 to 10 seconds. The avalanche swept him up, but he was able to escape to the skier’s right side of the avalanche 150 to 200 vertical feet below the ridge. He immediately looked back to the Rider 2 on the ridge and could not see her. He called out but there was no response.

## Rescue Summary
Skier 1 began a transceiver search. He followed the bed surface of the avalanche down the fall line he had started descending. He reached the avalanche debris in the gully without acquiring a transceiver signal. He transitioned to uphill travel and ascended the avalanche path to search additional areas. Skier 1 began a second search pattern and acquired a signal with a reading between 50 and 60 meters. He followed the signal to a point about 1350 vertical feet downhill from their starting point. His transceiver read 1.5 meters, and he got a positive probe strike. Skier 1 began digging. 

While Skier 1 was searching, two workers (Rescuers 1 and 2) at the nearby hut saw the fresh avalanche and began a rescue. Both Skier 1 and Rescuers 1 and 2 sent SOS messages from their respective InReach satellite messengers around 1 PM. Those messages initiated a search and rescue response. When Rescuers 1 and 2 reached the avalanche area, they began a transceiver search in the lower portions of the debris field near the confluence of the two forks. 

By this point, Skier 1 had dug down to Rider 2’s face, but she was not breathing and he could not find a pulse. Rescuers 1 and 2 came into view; they shouted and established contact with Skier 1. Rescuer 1 assisted Skier 1 with digging while Rescuer 2 acted as a lookout above the gully terrain trap.

The pair fully excavated Rider 2 after about 45 to 60 minutes of digging and about 90 minutes after the avalanche. She was buried about 6 feet deep. As they removed Rider 2 from the debris, Silverton Medical Rescue arrived. Rescuers moved Rider 2 out of the gully and provided care. A helicopter flew her to Silverton.

## Involvement Details
2 backcountry tourers caught, 1 buried and killed

## Lead-up Events
Two backcountry tourers were among the guests staying at a backcountry hut east of Ophir Pass. Rider 2 was a 41-year-old female who had spent extensive time in the backcountry and traveled on a splitboard. She had been to the hut a number of times before, was familiar with the area, and skied a terrain feature known as The Nose, between Crystal Lake and the Middle Fork of Mineral Creek, on previous trips. Skier 1 was a 40-year-old male. He was also an experienced backcountry tourer, but this was his first trip to the hut. They had toured together in the backcountry multiple times before this trip. They wore avalanche rescue transceivers and carried avalanche probes and shovels. 

The pair both read the avalanche forecast on February 20. To assess the avalanche conditions, they first planned to ride east-facing terrain around the hut where the slope angle was generally less than 30 degrees. Then, they planned to ascend a wind-scoured ridge on the north side of The Nose and descend the long, east-facing slope that terminates at the confluence of two branches of Mineral Creek. This slope was steeper, 35 to 40 degrees, than the terrain they would initially ski. Another party at the hut skied east-facing terrain near The Nose earlier in the day on February 20 and reported good surface conditions.

The pair made multiple ski runs on the lower-angle east-facing terrain. They observed no signs of instability. Then, they ascended the wind-scoured ridge. They took a brief break when they reached the ridgeline above The Nose. They worked their way along the ridge to a point above their intended descent of the east-facing slope.

## Avalanche Forecast
The Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s (CAIC) forecast for the area around Ophir Pass for February 20, 2025, rated the avalanche danger at Moderate (Level 2 of 5) at all elevations. The primary problem was Persistent Slab avalanches on west through north to east aspects near and above treeline and northwest through north to east aspects below treeline. The likelihood was Possible. The expected size was Small to Large (up to D2). The summary statement read: 

You could trigger an avalanche on steep slopes where recent snow has settled or drifted into a cohesive slab above weaker snow. The most dangerous slopes are at upper elevations where winds have drifted snow into deeper cohesive slabs. Look for and avoid trigger points near rock outcroppings, below cliff bands, or on steep convex rolls.

If you observe cracking or collapsing, reevaluate your plan and move to a lower angle or lower elevation slope. Sticking to slopes less than about 35 degrees in steepness will reduce your risk of triggering an avalanche.

## Additional Comments
All of the fatal avalanche accidents we investigate are tragic events. We do our best to describe each accident to help the people involved, and the community as a whole, better understand them. We offer the following comments in the hope that they will help people avoid future avalanche accidents.

The avalanche broke around the ridge and ran on slopes facing north through east. The flow split into several fingers around trees and terrain features as it ran. This resulted in essentially a triangular-shaped avalanche with debris spread over 2000 feet in several piles. The debris piled deep in the narrow gullies of the creekbed, and in places, even flowed down the gully. The result was an extensive search area with slow, challenging travel. It took Skier 1 about an hour to locate Rider 2 and clear her airway because of the massive area to search and burial depth over a meter.

Avalanche safety emphasizes traveling from safe spot to safe spot and only placing one person in avalanche terrain at a time. While we can never determine the exact events, investigators see two possibilities for why Rider 2 was caught in the avalanche. If she was standing in a location they assessed as safe, the slide must have broken above their presumed safe spot. Alternatively, Rider 2 may have moved onto the slope, possibly to keep Skier 1 in view, and was then below the crown when the avalanche released.

The Nose was the site of a  <a href="https://avalanche.state.co.us/report/f5efbd5e-5da3-4c2b-98e3-634907af1f67">fatal avalanche on February 2, 2021</a>. The avalanches broke to a similar extent (Figure 8, below). The 2021 avalanche was triggered from the gully, and the resulting burials were 10 to 20 feet deep. Rider 2 was caught near the top of the avalanche. She was buried under about 6 feet of snow, but the debris in the gully was up to 20 feet deep.

## Accident Summary
Rider 1 was the most experienced rider in his group and familiar with the terrain around Hahns Peak. He rode ahead to set a track for his less experienced friends. He did not wear an avalanche rescue transceiver or other avalanche rescue equipment. He did not intend to travel in avalanche terrain. 

Rider 1 chose the bottom of a small steep slope to set a turnaround track. He was unable to make the turn and jumped off his snowmobile. After landing in the snow, he was hit by an avalanche and fully buried. One of his arms was buried near his chest. He could wiggle that arm and punch it through to the surface. This created an air space. He continued to move his arm until he made enough space to call for help on his radio. He continued to dig himself out, eventually removing debris from around his head approximately 10 minutes after the avalanche. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUTC_kFOS1U&t=281s">Rider 1 published a video of his experience</a>.

His friends were not able to ride to his location. They flagged down another group for help that could ride to the avalanche. That group helped Rider 1 dig out himself and his mostly buried snowmobile.

They were the second party to descend a northeast-facing slope locally known as Nellie. Skier 1 descended the first portion of the slope and stopped. Skier 2 radioed that an avalanche had released, but Skier 1 could not escape. The 200-foot-wide avalanche caught and carried Skier 1 around 1100 vertical feet over cliffs and down a gully. They came to rest in the debris field, partially buried with their head and one arm above the snow. Skier 2 descended the bed surface and dug Skier 1 out. Skier 1 was not seriously injured but lost one ski. Another party helped the pair down Bear Creek and back to Telluride.

## Description
Made a long pull through some trees via snowmobile and when I came out of the timber there was a ENE face that definitely didn’t look inviting. I spun sled around on side hill and when I got oriented, the hill slid.
I was on the far edge of it and the entire slide was probably 80 yards wide, my sled was partially buried as shown in picture. I was next to sled when happen and was maybe buried up to my knees. The slabs of snow that sluffed off were probably 16-18” and below was complete sugar for 2-3’.

**Danger Rating:** High

## Accident Summary
Both riders were traveling near the bottom of a steep east-facing slope on the north end of Shrine Bowl. Rider 2 was uphill of Rider 1 on a steeper portion of the slope. Rider 1 stopped to let Rider 2 descend. Rider 1’s snowmobile sunk into the snow as he stopped. Rider 2 continued across the slope to avoid Rider 1. Rider 1 hit the throttle and wiggled his sled to try to get his sled back to the surface. He was hit by an avalanche from behind. Rider 2 looped around to check on Rider 1, but he was gone. All Rider 2 saw was the avalanche debris and no sign of Rider 1.

## Rescue Summary
Rider 2 went back to the last place he had seen Rider 1 and turned his avalanche rescue transceiver to search. He did not pick up a signal. At 12:10 PM he used his cell phone to call 911. He took out his probe pole and spot-probed likely burial points while he waited for help. 

Members of the Summit County Sherriff’s Office (SCSO) and the Summit County Rescue Group (SCRG) responded to the request for help. A Special Operations Unit Deputy Sheriff arrived at the Vail Pass Rest Area at approximately 12:30 PM. A Summit County Rescue Group (SCRG) volunteer was in the parking area preparing to go backcountry skiing when he received the notification about the accident. The two rescuers snowmobiled 2.5 miles to the accident site, arriving at the toe of the avalanche at 1:08 PM. The deputy began searching with his avalanche rescue transceiver but did not get a signal. The SCRG rescuer was walking over to interview Rider 2 when he noticed a small piece of orange fabric, no bigger than the size of a tennis ball, sticking out of the snow. He dug in the snow and realized it was the inflated airbag from Rider 1’s avalanche airbag pack. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fyH-8nLGpk">The SAR volunteer, deputy, and Rider 2</a> dug in the snow and hit Rider 1’s helmet with a shovel. They removed the snow from around the front of Rider 1’s helmet and he began to talk to the rescuers. He had been buried for just over an hour. Other rescuers reached the accident site and provided care for Rider 1. They transported him back to the parking lot and transferred him to an ambulance, which took him to a hospital.

## Involvement Details
1 snowmobiler caught, fully buried, and injured

## Lead-up Events
Riders 1 and 2 met at the parking lot at Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area at 8:30 AM on the morning of February 17. They had ridden together three times before. They discussed their plan for the day and confirmed that the avalanche airbags they both were wearing were armed. They did not discuss other avalanche safety equipment or check their avalanche rescue transceivers. 

They spent several hours riding in relatively flat terrain near Shrine and Ptarmigan Passes before riding toward the north end of Shrine Bowl.

## Avalanche Forecast
The Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s (CAIC) forecast for the area around Vail Pass for February 17, 2025, rated the avalanche danger at HIGH (Level 4 of 5). An Avalanche Warning was in place. There were two avalanche problems listed. The first problem was Persistent Slab avalanches on northwest through north to east aspects. The likelihood was Likely, and the expected size was Large to Very Large (up to D3). The second problem was Storm Slab avalanches. It was highlighted on all aspects and at all elevations. The likelihood was Very Likely, and the expected size was Small to Large (up to D2). The summary statement read: 

"An Avalanche Warning is in effect for the Summit area. Heavy snow and strong winds will create very dangerous avalanche conditions starting early Monday and lasting through Tuesday. Large avalanches will be easy to trigger, and some could release naturally. You can trigger avalanches in the new snow large enough to bury you. Some avalanches will break deeper in the snowpack, propagating broader and larger than expected. You could trigger an avalanche from a distance or below. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended during this time."

## Additional Comments
We do our best to describe avalanche accidents to help the people involved, and the community as a whole better understand them. We offer the following comments in the hope that they will help people avoid future avalanche accidents.

On the day of the accident, Rider 1 forgot his avalanche rescue transceiver at home. The two did not check their transceivers at the trailhead or discuss if not having this piece of equipment would impact their plans for the day. The two did check their avalanche airbags, which likely contributed to Rider 1’s survival. This accident highlights the importance of checking your equipment at the trailhead before heading into the backcountry.

Avalanche airbag packs are an important piece of avalanche safety equipment and can increase your chance of survival (<a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(14)00566-8/abstract">by 44%</a>); however, they do not guarantee your survival. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1016/j.wem.2018.04.002">Twenty-nine percent of the people killed in Colorado in an avalanche died from a traumatic injury they sustained in the avalanche</a>. Airbags can fail to inflate when you need them for a variety of reasons (see the first citation in this paragraph). You can also still get buried with an inflated airbag as was the case in this accident. While carrying an avalanche airbag is a great idea, you should also have a device that allows people to find you if you get buried in the debris. The best way to “be searchable” is to wear an avalanche rescue transceiver. In most cases, digging someone out of avalanche debris is the most time-consuming part of the rescue, so you should also carry an avalanche probe and shovel every time you enter avalanche terrain. 

Rider 1 survived under the snow for about an hour, which is unusual. Your chances of living longer than 1 hour under the snow are <a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(14)00566-8/abstract">less than 25% and maybe less than 10%</a>. The three most common mechanisms for death in an avalanche are traumatic injury in the ride, asphyxiation in the debris, and hypothermia. Rider 1’s survival is likely due to the combination of a few factors and we can think about these issues in conjunction with these three mechanisms. Trauma: Rider 1 did not sustain a life-threatening injury in the avalanche. His ride in the avalanche was not violent enough to injure him and the debris did not push him into trees, rocks, or over a cliff. Asphysia: Rider 1’s airway was not obstructed and he had enough of an air pocket in the debris to breathe for over an hour. There are a few factors that likely contributed to this. First, the debris was relatively soft and uncompacted. Second, he wore a snowcross helmet that kept snow from packing into his mouth and nose. Third, he was buried on his side facing downhill with his inflated airbag uphill of his head, which limited snow compaction around his head. Hypothermia: Although Riders 1 and 2 needed help from an outside rescue group, the rescue was fast and efficient. The Summit County Sheriff’s Office and Summit County Rescue Group reached the accident site within an hour of the 911 call. They quickly resolved a potentially difficult rescue scenario, provided critical care, and brought the riders out of the backcountry. The rescue team’s effort certainly played an important role in the positive outcome. This could have easily been a fatal avalanche accident.

## Accident Summary
Two CAIC forecasters conducting fieldwork near Vail Pass parked their snowmobiles at the top of Ptarmigan Hill. The pair walked downhill over areas of bare ground and hard windboard to see if they could access a <a href ="https://avalanche.state.co.us/report/ad295dd6-f6f1-4e10-803a-e664d04f3ec9">recent avalanche that was triggered on February 2</a>. They moved west across a bare slope onto a low-angle area of very hard, wind-drifted snow. They could see the old avalanche and discussed how to get there to do a crown profile. They decided the fastest way was to walk back uphill to their snowmobiles on the ridge, snowmobile down the ridge, and try to access it from above. As they were ascending, they felt the slope collapse and saw cracks. The forecaster in the front moved uphill to safety. The other forecaster, who was about 6 feet behind, scrambled a few feet to his left to the safety of the bed surface. The pair watched as the avalanche ripped out a big portion of Avalanche Bowl to their right. This was a hard slab avalanche unintentionally triggered by the forecasters while they were walking uphill. They were on a 27-degree slope when they triggered the avalanche. The crown face where they were walking was only about 4 inches deep, but the crown face in the steeper part of the slidepath was up to 8 feet deep. The avalanche was about 700 feet wide and ran about 600 vertical feet (HS-AFu-R3-D2).

## Description
A dry slab avalanche was triggered by the first skier down the chute. Skier hit a section of hidden rocks adjacent to the chute which caused the slide to crack from above. The area was windy and there was recent snowfall. Likely a wind slab had built up in the chute, and appeared to step down to deeper layers. The crown was ~3 feet deep at the largest. The skier was caught and carried down the slope, skis ejected, and partially buried. Luckily the runout zone was relatively short and the slide stopped moving quickly.

## Description
Entering into gold king basin we had signs of wind loading from the southwest accumulating on the sides of the Alta lakes roads, with collapsing. However this was at 11,300 elevation on the road. No signs of instability on the climb as the route we climb on the south face had slid in the previous week. On top of the ridge significantly wind blown with little to no base just under on south face. The top of the couloir was extremely firm but held a decent edge. Given my previous sighting of a major slid and a small slide lower skiers left, We decided to drop. As I safetied to the skiers right at the bottom of the couloir I noticed some wind loading but it felt mostly stable. No shooting cracks, no instability, no rumbling or whomping. Second skier came down lost and edges just above my safety spot and triggered the slab to go. Be mindful out there wind is tricky even when your studying your line for over a month.

## Accident Summary
Riders 1 and 2 read the avalanche forecast the night before and discussed it again in the morning. They left the Current Creek trailhead around 10AM. They observed drifting snow on their ascent. Rider 1 descended a southeast-facing slope commonly referred to as "Teacup Bowl" while Rider 2 captured video from a safe location. Rider 1 fell midslope and triggered the avalanche. Rider 1 was hit from behind by moving debris and carried downslope. Rider 1 managed to get his snowboard in front of him before he hit a small tree. The impact broke his snowboard, but Rider 1 believes it helped prevent him from being buried. When the debris stopped, Rider 1 was sitting upright with his head above the snow. Rider 1 extricated himself from the debris. The pair encountered another party immediately after the avalanche and assured that group that they could return to the trailhead without assistance.

## Description
Upon traversing toward the ridge, we encountered a ENE-facing rollover (40-45 degrees, 30-45 vertical feet) that appeared to have some wind-effect.  Upon scouting the descent, my pole broke through a snow bridge against the rock outcropping, identifying a weak area.  Elected to descend the rollover anyway, as it would have been difficult to backtrack.  After making 2 turns, the slope fractured above me into an R1 D1 slab, with no shooting cracks, whoomfing, or other signs of instability.  Was able to point toward the N side edge and ski out of the avalanche.  Slab was about 10m wide, and ran 10-15m. Crown ranged from 1cm to 30-45cm (estimated from images). 

This was not a consequential slide, but did serve as an indicator of the wind slab problem.

## Involvement Summary
- Caught: 1

## Accident Summary
I was able to see the slab fracture to my right, bank a hard left turn and skied off of the slab. I'd say it carried me about 5 feet downhill.
Thickness where I was was only a few inches, 3-6, as I triggered at a thin point in the slab.  Further to my right, the crown was much taller, 12-18in, in limited areas.

We (3skiers) were skiing down the ridge above Corkscrew Rd.   As we approached the road, one skier headed around the "nose" to a easterly facing slope at about 11,500 ft elevation.  The other two skiers headed down on a more southeast slope. Skier one entered the Corkscrew Rd cut when the avalanche  occurred.  It looked like the crown was above him near the top of the road cut.  The slope was probably slightly over 35 degrees.  The avalanche carried the skier down to the lower Corkscrew rd.  He was partially buried to the top of his legs.

## Rescue Summary
Skier 1 missed a check-in with his spouse. His spouse, Rescuer 1, notified the Ouray County Sheriff that he was overdue and then drove to Red Mountain Pass. She snowshoed to the slope Skier 1 planned to ski. 

Rescuer 1 saw the avalanche on the slope Skier 1 intended to ski. She initiated a transceiver search and immediately acquired a signal with a reading of 56 meters. She used her transceiver to find Skier 1’s location, pinpointed him with her avalanche probe, and began to dig in the debris. She yelled for help, and soon other backcountry skiers in the area arrived, followed by members of Ouray Mountain Rescue Team (OMRT). They helped remove Skier 1 from the debris. OMRT provided medical care and transported Skier 1 to the highway.

The Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s (CAIC) forecast for the area around Red Mountain Pass for January 7, 2025, rated the avalanche danger at Moderate (Level 2 of 5) at all elevations. The primary problem was Persistent Slab avalanches on west through northeast to southeast aspects above treeline and west through northeast to east near and below treeline. The likelihood was possible. The expected size was Small to Large (up to D2). The summary statement read: 

If you find a shallow spot and collapse a hard layer of snow that rests above weaker snow below, you can trigger an avalanche that will be large enough to injure or kill you. You can trigger avalanches from the margins of these stiff slabs from a distance or below. If you trigger an avalanche, it could be deeper and wider than expected. Avoid traveling near common trigger points, such as convex rollovers, rocky outcrops, or the edges of slopes with thinner margins of a slab.

You may not observe these signs of instability before triggering an avalanche. Give yourself a wide buffer from suspect slopes steeper than about 35 degrees. 

New snow overnight Tuesday could raise danger again at upper elevations.

## Additional Comments
All of the fatal avalanche accidents we investigate are tragic events. We do our best to describe each accident to help the people involved, and the community as a whole better understand them. We offer the following comments in the hope that they will help people avoid future avalanche accidents.

Skier 1 was traveling alone. CAIC investigators were unable to speak to anyone who witnessed the accident or the events leading up to it. Our comments are based on information we collected from the accident site and interviews with rescuers. There was a skin track (uphill) and seven ski tracks (downhill) on the slope prior to the avalanche. These tracks were made by Skier 1 and possibly other backcountry skiers. The uphill track went up the north side, or climber’s left, of the slope. We suspect the downhill tracks began closest to the uphill track and then moved to the south, climber’s right, with each successive run. The avalanche released from a subridge on the southern side, climber’s right, of the slope and ran over portions of four previous ski tracks.

Based on tracks and equipment, Skier 1 was descending at the time of the avalanche. He was wearing an avalanche rescue transceiver and an avalanche airbag backpack. The backpack was armed and functional, but it was not deployed.

Backcountry travel in a group is generally safer than traveling alone. A well-equipped group that uses safe travel protocols will have more resources to enact a rescue if something goes wrong. However, like the decision to travel on a specific route during certain avalanche conditions, solo travel is a personal choice. Between October 1, 2020, and January 7, 2025, solo backcountry travelers accounted for 18% (6 of 33) of avalanche deaths in Colorado. In each of the last five avalanche seasons, at least one solo traveler has died in an avalanche in Colorado.

Rescuer 1 was expecting a call from Skier 1 at the end of his ski day. When he did not call, she alerted authorities and went to check on Skier 1. Despite these actions, Skier 1 may have been buried for more than four hours before help arrived. Skier 1 was buried about 1 meter deep, too deep to effect a self-rescue from avalanche debris.

McCammon (<a href="https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/item.php?id=837">2002</a>) identified several common heuristic patterns in a retrospective analysis of avalanche accidents. Heuristics are pragmatic mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making in complex situations and often operate below the level of deliberate decision-making. Heuristics become “traps” when the informational cues are inappropriate or not relevant to the situation, leading to undesirable outcomes. Heuristic traps can be generally identified after the fact. Specific queues or decision points are impossible to identify in this accident because Skier 1 was alone.

McCammon described “familiarity” as using past actions to support current behaviors. Successive tracks shifted southwards across the slope, possibly with no indications of snowpack instability. Skier 1 skied an adjacent slope the day before with no signs of instability. He had skied on Red Mountain Pass for 16 years and knew the terrain on Red Number 3 well. He chose his terrain as appropriate for the day based on his previous experience of the slope and the snowpack. 

McCammon described “scarcity” as psychological reactance expressed as competition for the limited resource of untracked snow. Downhill tracks were adjacent to each other and did not cross. Each run could be made in fresh snow. The effect was a gradual shift southward with each run, closer to the wind-drifted snow that would eventually avalanche. Possibly coupled with the reinforcement of familiarity, there could have been a series of cues that made Skier 1 more comfortable with his final ski track.

## Accident Summary
On Monday, January 6, 2025, a solo skier was caught and carried in an avalanche path locally known as Timber Falls and King Arthur. He entered the chute from the skier's right and, after a few turns, looked over his shoulder and noticed a large powder cloud coming towards him. He tried to traverse skier's left to to thicker trees. The avalanche knocked him off his feet and carried him most of the way down the chute. When the avalanche stopped, he was uninjured, on top of the debris but without skis or poles. He contacted friends in the area who brought skis to the bottom of the chute. The skier descended using his friends' skis.

The skier previously skied the slope two days before, on Saturday, January 4, 2025. He noticed older, smaller slides below the lower cliff band then.

## Accident Summary
<p>Snowshoers 1 and 2 started at Red Mountain Pass and followed CR31 northwards towards Guston. They planned to stay on the road. They were familiar with the area and had traveled the road many times in the winter. They were not carrying avalanche rescue equipment and did not read the current avalanche forecast, but were generally aware of the <a href=”https://avalanche.state.co.us/?date=2025-01-06&lat=37.95592600530133&lng=-107.63891601562499”>dangerous avalanche conditions</a>.</p>
<p>The road cuts across a short, steep slope in Champion Gulch. They “had never seen the slope avalanche in 30 years” but still chose to cross one at a time because of the dangerous avalanche conditions. Just before 1PM, Snowshoer 1 broke trail about 150 feet along the road and waited on the other side of the slope.</p>
<p>Snowshoer 2 was partway across when he triggered the avalanche. He had time to tell Snowshoer 1 to “run” before the avalanche swept him backward off the road and into the gully below. He tried to keep his ski pole up during the avalanche. When the avalanche stopped, he was on his back, head downhill. His head was under the snow, but he could wave his pole and knew it was above the debris (partially buried - critical).</p>
<p>After the avalanche, Snowshoer 1 carefully navigated around adjacent steep slopes and into the gully. She could see the pole waving around. She unburied Snowshoer 2’s head using her snowshoe as a shovel. It was approximately 15 minutes between the avalanche and uncovering his face. Snowshoer 2 did not lose consciousness. At 1:34PM, Snowshoer 1 was able to call 911 using emergency satellite communications on her phone. She continued to dig with her snowshoe while shouting for help.  Two other backcountry recreators heard her shouting and reached the avalanche around 2:20PM. They had shovels and proceeded to dig out Snowshoer 2. All four walked about a half mile on CR31 before they met with Ouray County Search and Rescue at 3:05PM. Snowshoer 1 sustained minor hand injuries while digging. Snowshoer 2 sustained minor scrapes and mild cold injuries.</p>

## Additional Comments
We do our best to describe avalanche involvements to help the people involved and the community as a whole better understand them. We offer the following comments with the hope that they will help people avoid future avalanche accidents.

Snowshoers 1 and 2 generally knew of the dangerous avalanche conditions and planned to stick to the road and avoid avalanche terrain. They recognized and only exposed one party member at a time to the hazardous slope. Snowshoer 1 carefully avoided other steep slopes on her way into the gully to avoid additional avalanches.

Neither party member was carrying avalanche rescue equipment. Snowshoer 2 was determined to keep his hand and pole up as an indicator, something he credited to his waterskiing experience. It would have been a slower search without the obvious clue of a ski pole waving around and no other rescue equipment. His arm may have contributed to air circulation and prevented loss of consciousness. A shovel would have sped up the excavation time, but Snowshoer 1 was able to use her snowshoe to dig.

Snowshoer 1 was carrying a device capable of emergency satellite communications. Although it took a few minutes to connect, she was able to alert 911. She did this after exposing Snowshoer 2’s face and determining they would need assistance. She continued to shout, knowing other people were likely recreating in the nearby backcountry. Two backcountry skiers heard her. They were carrying avalanche rescue equipment and quickly finished digging Snowshoer 2 free.

The avalanche was small (D1.5) and ran about 100 vertical feet. The debris piled in the gully formed by a steep slope and mine tailings, deep enough to bury a person. <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvznRpuWN_E”>Terrain traps</a> like narrow gullies increase the consequences of even small avalanches. Snow cracked but did not avalanche on the steep mine tailings opposite the road cut.  

This was an experienced couple who had recreated in the winter on Red Mountain Pass for almost 30 years. They went out for a “casual day” when things went very wrong. Their determination, clear thinking during a stressful event, and ingenuity helped them walk out with only minor injuries. They were generous enough to share their experience with the CAIC in the hope of helping others avoid similar situations in the future.

## Description
Ascended a gentle east facing ridgeline to gain the Peak 5 Summit ridge. While ascending, I felt a few collapses, one of them propagated almost 100 yards to a ~12k SE face under 30 degrees. It was not steep enough to slide, but the propagating cracks were massive and appeared to reach the ground at the crown line. 

Once on the summit ridge, I descended the East aspect, staying skier's right of a known avalanche path. I knew I could probably get it to slide. When I triggered it, I was sking across a section of slope less than 30* on average, but had a small pitch or two that was over 30*. The slab started moving very slowly underneath me. I was easily able to ski off it to safety. 

The caltopo map attached shows the slide area. My location at point of trigger was on the map cursor. It seems as though the slab was cohesive enough to carry some lower angle terrain down for a short ride.

Pretty big slide. Crown face looked nearly 3 feet tall and I cant imagine a slide running much wider than it did today.

## Description
Our group ended up skiing too far past the standard egress resulting in a decision to ski a short, steeper section to return to the desired side of the main drainage. Upon triggering separate avalanches remotely earlier in the day, we were aware of the danger, and chose this option knowing the slope may fail. I skied across the slope, feeling the slab slow beneath my feet, slowing me down as I cut across. The slab failed from above me and I was briefly knocked off my feet but stayed on top of the snow. There was very low energy of the moving snow. I was able to stand upright almost immediately and ski down to trees below. The avalanche only moved 15-20 feet downhill. Height of crown was estimated at 16-20 inches, length of crown was approximately 50-60 feet wide.

Oomfs 😳🙊 we tickled the dragon 🐲🐉 in a below treeline wind slab. Skiing with a partner and I hit a weak spot near a convex roll. As I initiated the turn I heard a woosh and the snow around me started to move. It caught up with me and I basically sat on top of it. It was a small wind slab; maybe about 12-15 feet wide. The wind slab itself was about 8 inches thick of medium density sitting on top light snow. 

I was uninjured. I clicked out of one ski. Poking around the area could feel more of the same wind slab. Luckily it was small. 

We were on a northerly aspect at Jones Pass. This terrain is frequently skied. 

We were able to confirm the forecast.

## Accident Summary
<p>Skier 1 left his car at the top of Berthoud Pass around noon on Tuesday, December 3, 2024. He was traveling alone and planned to ascend and descend the low-angle, heavily trafficked west-facing slopes on Colorado Mines Peak, east of the pass. Skier 1 had skied on Berthoud Pass many times but only a few times on the east side. He made a plan to avoid avalanche terrain because he was alone. He did not read the <a href=https://avalanche.state.co.us/?lat=39.7983203&lng=-105.7777849&date=2024-12-03">current avalanche forecast</a> on the day of the accident.</p>
<p>On his first run, Skier 1 ascended west-facing slopes and descended tight trees back to the road. He decided to go a little further north to a slightly different aspect for his second run, towards the north face of Colorado Mines Peak. He stopped about 600 vertical feet below the summit on the ridge dividing the westerly-facing from the north-facing slopes – close to the top of an avalanche path locally known as Mines 2 – to remove his skis and prepare to ski downhill. He did not see the large natural avalanche that ran two days before in Mines 1, a nearby avalanche path uphill and to the east of his transition point.</p>
<p>Skier 1 descended along the ridgeline above the Mines 2 avalanche path. He made “one or two” turns into the top of Mines 2. He did not intend to ski the slope and only wanted to check the snow conditions. He saw a large crack shoot out in front of him and an avalanche break above him. He took a hard left turn and skied off the moving snow. Another wave of moving snow hit him from above and carried him down the slope.</p>
<p>The avalanche dragged Skier 1 through small trees lower on the slope. He “swam” and kept his feet and skis oriented downhill. The avalanche eventually dragged him under, and he lost both skis. During the avalanche, Skier 1 knew that "when the debris slowed down, it was my chance to try and fight and get my head above the snow." When the debris stopped, Skier 1’s arms were out of the snow but his face and head were buried by about six inches of debris (partially buried - critical). Despite suffering a dislocated shoulder in the avalanche, Skier 1 was able to dig himself out of the debris and call 911 on his cell phone. The avalanche had swept him about 400 vertical feet through small trees, and he came to rest about three-quarters of the way down the avalanche path.</p>
<p>Skier 1 hiked down the avalanche debris into the drainage and downhill towards US 40. He met Grand Country Search and Rescue (GCSAR) one and a half to two hours after the avalanche. GCSAR transported him to the highway and transferred him to a waiting ambulance that transported him to emergency care.</p>

## Avalanche Forecast
The Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s (CAIC) forecast for the Berthoud Pass area for December 3, 2024, rated the avalanche danger at Considerable (Level 3 of 5) near and above treeline and Moderate (Level 2 of 5) below treeline. There were two avalanche problems listed. The first problem was Persistent Slab avalanches on northwest to northeast through southeast aspects. The likelihood was Likely, and the expected size was Small to Large (up to D2). The second problem listed was Wind Slab avalanches on east through southeast to south aspects near and above treeline with a likelihood of Possible and an expected size of Small to Large (up to D2). The summary statement read: 

"You can trigger an avalanche on northerly, easterly, and south-facing slopes. You can trigger slides that only break in drifted snow, but the bigger hazard is slides that break in weak snow near the ground. On northerly and easterly aspects, weak snow is abundant close to the ground and slides can easily step down to this layer resulting in a large avalanche. You may not see any signs of instability before you trigger an avalanche. Low-angle and wind-sheltered slopes are safer options."

## Additional Comments
Skier 1 was traveling alone and did not read the current avalanche forecast. As such, he planned to avoid avalanche terrain (although he was wearing a beacon and carrying a probe and shovel). He would have avoided the avalanche hazard if he stuck to his plan. Things went awry when he deviated from his plan and made several turns into the top of the Mines 2 avalanche path. In an interview with the CAIC, Skier 1 said he "didn't have a stop-and-think moment soon enough." If he had seen the natural avalanche in the Mines 1 path, it may have prompted him to stop and stay on his planned route. Fortunately, Skier 1 survived and shared his experience with the CAIC to hopefully allow other people to avoid similar situations in the future.

## Involvement Summary
- Caught: 1

## Accident Summary
Two backcountry snowboarders planned to climb uphill past the Broome Hut in Second Creek and descend a steep northeast-facing slope. They read the avalanche forecast before starting their trip. They also discussed the consequences and risks of an avalanche on that terrain feature. They talked about how if they triggered an avalanche, it would be small.

While ascending, Rider 1 dug a quick hand pit and found a several-inch thick slab of drifted snow that failed while isolating the column. They thought the slab was too thin to result in an avalanche. Rider 1 went first and descended the slope without an issue. Rider 2 began descending and triggered the avalanche in wind-drifted snow after several turns. Rider 2 was caught and carried through rocks but was not buried or injured in the avalanche.

## Accident Summary
Five skiers left the top of Red Mountain Pass, traveling into Senator Beck Basin. Once the group reached the Senator Beck Weather station, visibility was in and out, and the group traveled west toward Trico Peak. Their plan was to descend the northeast side of a low-angle gully feature and then into a southeast gully into the lower Trico basin. The group descended the top of the slope without incident. At around 12,500 feet, the group observed some wind loading and went to assess slab stiffness. Skiers 1 and 2 peeked over the edge of a northeast-facing steep gully feature and noted stiffening. Skiers 3, 4, and 5 were just behind but higher on the ridge. This was not a slope they planned to descend. Skier 1, further down the slope, made a big jump turn. Upon landing, the slab of snow Skiers 1 and 2 were standing on started to move downhill. Skiers 1 and 2 were caught and carried around 10-15 feet downhill before stepping off the moving snow on both sides. The avalanche was smaller in size, but the ride could have been consequential. Skiers 3-5 were not involved in the moving snow. The party regrouped on the ridge and safely descended into the Trico area and back to the top of Red Mountain Pass.
